# ESP32 Pool Control System v3.1

**Control your swimming pool remotely. Simple. Secure. Cloud-connected.**

✅ **Production Ready** | 🌐 **Cloud MQTT** | 📱 **Mobile Dashboard** | 🔒 **Encrypted Communications**

---

## What It Does

Automate your pool with **simple controls**:
- 💧 **Pump Control** - Turn pump ON/OFF remotely or on schedule
- 🌊 **Valve Modes** - Switch between Cascada (waterfall) and Eyectores (jets) modes
- 🌡️ **Temperature Monitoring** - Real-time water temperature display
- ⏱️ **Countdown Timer** - Set duration for automatic shutoff
- 📅 **Weekly Scheduling** - Create up to 3 programs, auto-execute daily
- 🎨 **Modern Dashboard** - Beautiful, responsive UI works on phone/tablet/desktop
- 🔄 **Manual Override** - Physical switches still work if needed
- 🖥️ **Standard MQTT** - Compatible with any MQTT client (Home Assistant, Node-RED, custom apps)

**No commercial subscription. Works locally. Takes 30 seconds to set up.**

## Quick Start

### 1. Hardware (~$50)
- ESP32 DevKit (any variant)
- Dual relay module
- DS18B20 temperature sensor
- Power supply + enclosure

[👉 Full hardware list & wiring guide](docs/WIRING_DIAGRAM.md)

### 2. Firmware (2 minutes)
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd IoT/firmware

# Copy secrets template
cp include/"secrets (example).h" include/secrets.h

# Edit with your WiFi/MQTT credentials, then upload
platformio run --target upload
```

WiFi boot priority (v3.1+):
1. Try WiFi credentials saved in NVS (from previous BLE/WiFiManager provisioning)
2. If NVS credentials fail, try fallback networks from `include/secrets.h` in order: `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_SSID_2`, `WIFI_SSID_3`
3. If all fail, start BLE provisioning

When a fallback network connects successfully, it is saved to NVS automatically for faster next boot.

### 3. Dashboard (1 minute)
Dashboard auto-deploys to Cloudflare Pages. Or deploy yourself to any static host.

URL: `https://your-domain.pages.dev` → Login → Connect to MQTT broker

That's it! You now have a pool controller. 🎉

**Note on Pump Display Logic:** Due to the relay wiring configuration, the dashboard displays inverted pump states - it shows "ON" when the firmware sends "OFF" and vice versa. This is intentional and matches the physical relay behavior. See [Wiring Diagram](docs/WIRING_DIAGRAM.md#pump-control---inverted-display-logic) for details.

| Weekly Scheduling | ✅ Active | Up to 3 programs, daily execution |
| WiFi Provisioning | ✅ Active | BLE (Android/macOS) or Captive Portal (iOS) |
| Manual Override | ✅ Active | Physical switches work independently |
| Event Logging | ✅ Active | Real-time log with timestamps |
| MQTT over TLS | ✅ Active | Secure end-to-end encryption |

## Architecture & Design

**Single-User Design** (today):
- One ESP32 controls one pool
- Dashboard runs in your browser
- Direct MQTT connection to cloud broker (HiveMQ)
- Perfect for personal use, homes, small installations
- **Requires**: Internet connection + WiFi (not offline-capable)

**How It Works:**
1. Dashboard (browser) → Internet → HiveMQ Cloud MQTT broker
2. ESP32 (WiFi) → MQTT broker → subscribes to commands
3. ESP32 → Temperature readings → MQTT broker → Dashboard
4. 100-500ms latency (depending on WiFi + internet connection)

## Testing Without Hardware

Use the included simulator to test the dashboard without a real ESP32:

```bash
pip install paho-mqtt
python test_simulator.py
```

Then open dashboard and connect to the simulated device. Full feature testing.

## Tech Stack

- **Hardware:** ESP32 DevKit + relay modules + DS18B20 sensor
- **Firmware:** Arduino C++ with PlatformIO
- **Dashboard:** Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) + HTML/CSS
- **Communication:** MQTT over WebSocket (TLS encrypted)
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages (dashboard) + HiveMQ Cloud (MQTT broker)
- **Cost:** ~$10-15/month (MQTT broker only; everything else free/one-time)

---

## Security

✅ All MQTT traffic encrypted with TLS  
✅ Username/password authentication with broker  
⚠️ Credentials hardcoded in dashboard (acceptable for personal use)  

---

## Future Roadmap

Potential enhancements if needed:
- Multi-device support (different pools)
- OTA firmware updates
- Historical data analytics  
- Home Assistant integration
